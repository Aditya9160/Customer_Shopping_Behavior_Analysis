# Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis
# Data Analytics Project — README

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data-analysis workflow. The work spans loading raw data, conducting exploratory analysis, preparing the dataset, executing SQL queries across common database systems, designing a Power BI dashboard.

## Dataset

Define the dataset source, size, and structure. State the number of rows, columns, and the purpose of the data. Clarify any assumptions made during ingestion.

## Tools Used

* Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
* SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)
* Power BI
* Jupyter Notebook or any preferred IDE

## Project Steps

### 1. Load Data in Python

Import the dataset. Validate file types and encodings. Inspect initial structure. Confirm schema consistency.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Profile distributions. Identify missing values, outliers, and anomalies. Generate summary statistics. Examine correlations and trends.

### 3. Data Cleaning

Handle nulls. Standardize formats. Remove duplicates. Fix inconsistent categories. Engineer necessary fields for downstream queries.

### 4. SQL Analysis

Load the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server. Run analytical queries to extract metrics, aggregates, and relationship insights. Validate results against the Python layer.

### 5. Dashboard Development in Power BI

Import the final dataset. Build visuals aligned with project objectives. Use measures, calculated columns, and filters to highlight actionable insights. Organize the dashboard for clarity.

### 6. Report Creation

Document the workflow, findings, and interpretation. Support claims with evidence from SQL and visual analysis.

## Dashboard

Screenshot or description placeholder. Summarize key visuals and the insights they reveal. State why the layout supports decision-making.

## Results

List the main analytical conclusions. Tie each result to a corresponding query, visualization, or derived metric. State the value these findings deliver.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Python notebook for data loading, EDA, and cleaning.
4. Import the cleaned dataset into your SQL environment.
5. Execute the SQL scripts provided in the `sql/` folder.
6. Open the Power BI file to view or modify the dashboard.
